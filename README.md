### operation

- Place all [markdown](https://github.com/yogthos/markdown-clj) files (ie. your original posts, entries, and pages) into a folder situated as `/db/`. The filenames should end in `.md` and the file contents can include [metadata](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide#metadata), of which only `Title`, `Date`, and `Keywords` are used.
- All other aspects (eg. the navigation bar, or the "pages" page) are hardcoded.
