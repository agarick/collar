*** use

- Place all markdown files (eg. your individual blog posts) into a folder situated as =db/=. The filenames should end in =.md= and the file contents can include metadata, of which only =title=, =date=, =keywords=, and =js= * are used.
  - * the =js= key does not appear in the [[https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide#metadata][MultiMarkdown]] specs, but [[https://github.com/yogthos/markdown-clj][yogthos/markdown-clj]] seems to recognise arbitrary keys nonetheless.

example, /db\slash{}n.md:/
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
title: Neuromancer (William Gibson)
date: 457488001
keywords: Science Fiction, Cyberpunk
js: wintermute.min.js

# Part 1, Chiba City Blues

The sky above the port was the color of ...
#+END_SRC

- Create a profile config, under "development", "next", or "master".

example, /config\slash{}master\slash{}config.edn:/
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:env "master"
 :port 8000}
#+END_SRC

- Execute =lein with-profile PROFILE run=. Following the above config example, "PROFILE" would be "master".
